This folder contains the reference design software for the TIDEP-01032 (EtherCAT-Connected, Single-Chip, Dual-Servo Motor Drive Reference Design for AM243x Systems). It is included as a part of the Motor Control SDK 09.01.00. Currently the FOC loop used for Closed Speed (Velocity) Control is based on the CMSIS library. We will switch to the RTLib functions and DCL functions in the near future.
