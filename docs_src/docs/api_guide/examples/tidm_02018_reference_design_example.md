# TIDM-02018 Universal Motor Control Reference Design for AM263x Arm® Based MCU Devices {#EXAMPLE_TIDM_02018_REFERENCE_DESIGN}

This reference design offers a universal motor control design for TI’s AM263x Arm® based microcontrollers (MCUs). The design shows how to use AM263x MCUs for various kinds of FOC motor control techniques, such as sensorless (eSMO) and sensored (incremental encoder, Hall sensor). The design supports two main hardware setups, a low-voltage setup using AM263x LaunchPad™ with 3PHGANINV BoosterPack™ and a high-voltage setup using AM263x controlCARD™ with TMDSHVMTRINSPIN motor control kit. The documentation also covers instructions on migrating the design to a custom board and porting the project to new devices.

## Features Supported

- Comprehensive software package, tools and documentation to reduce development time of motor control systems based on AM263x MCUs.
- Various FOC motor control methods supported, such as Sensorless (eSMO) and Sensored (Incremental Encoder, Hall sensor) control.
- System features and debug interfaces included which are compatible with many three-phase inverter motor evaluation kits.
- Sysconfig-based project allows for easier migration between different devices and boards with a user-friendly graphical user interface to speed up software development.
